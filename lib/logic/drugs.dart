      'Monitoring Parameters':'In patients with hypertension, use of propranolol has been associated with elevated levels of serum potassium, serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. In severe heart failure, the use of propranolol has been associated with increases in Blood Urea Nitrogen.',
      'Precautions':'1) Abrupt discontinuation can result in the exacerbation of angina, myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, or severe hypertension, especially in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. If chronic, oral propranolol therapy is to be discontinued, the dosage should be gradually decreased over a minimum of 2 weeks. \n'
          '2) Downward titration of parenteral therapy may be advisable if the patient will discontinue propranolol treatment. Patients and caregivers should be advised against interruption or cessation of therapy without the advice of a physician.\n'
          '3) If exacerbation of angina occurs during discontinuation of therapy, it is advised to reinstitute propranolol therapy and take other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina.\n'
          '4) It should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. It is not indicated for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies.\n'
          '5) Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade can cause reduction of intraocular pressure. Patients should be told that Inderal may interfere with the glaucoma screening test. Withdrawal may lead to a return of increased intraocular pressure.',
